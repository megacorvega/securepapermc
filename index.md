## Intro

This is a guide for securing your public IP and utilizing the wonderful TCPShield services for DDoS protection. By the end of this guide we will achieve the following:

- Create domain through Cloudflare
- Start up a free Google Cloud proxy
- Setup TCPShield for your PaperMC server address

This guide assumes you already have a PaperMC server up and running. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st8F2MPyHKk) is an easy to follow video on how to get one going for 1.16.1.

**NOTE: This guide assumes you understand the risks of opening ports of your computer to the internet. This guide does not guarantee safety from hackers/DDoS attacks/etc. This guide simply offers another layer of protection that will be much, much safer than running your server directly attached to your public IP.**
